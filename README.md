# Event Planner

Event Planner is a web application for organizing and managing events, built with a modern and efficient stack.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for building user interfaces

*(Optionally add Tailwind CSS here if it's used in your CSS files or postcss config, but it's not present in your package.json)*
